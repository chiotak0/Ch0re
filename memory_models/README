- regfile_2r1w: is for the RISC-V Register-File 2 read-ports 1 write-port
- mem_sync_sp: is a synchronous single port SRAM for the IMEM
- mem_sync_sp_rvdmem: is a synchronous single port SRAM for the DMEM and has some tricks for simulation behavior that can be used with simulation risc-v infrastructure
